Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

# Plan

- When the user asks to implement according to a plan, ALWAYS follow the plan closely, implement all the proposals or the requested features until completing all of them. After finishing, always verify by compiling successfully and running unit tests or integration tests.

# Terminal

- ALWAYS prevent Fish or other Shells from recording the running commands in history

# Editing

- Always edit files directly. Do not create any script to do the editing, especially when you have to encode a large amount of content into the script.

# Verification

- Always ensure that the generated code compiles without errors.
